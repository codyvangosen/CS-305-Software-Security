CS-305-Software-Security

This is a repository of my project files and final submission for my final portfolio for the CS-305 Class at SNHU.

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that specializes in handling sensitive financial transactions and private client data. This results in software requirements to ensure secure communications while maintaining data integrity and protection. The implementation of software requirements must comply with legal and regulatory standards domestically and internationally. Artemis Financial wished to identify and address any vulnerabilities that could leak private or sensitive financial data to malicious users or other external threats.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely?

For this project, the identification of key vulnerabilities within the application was particularly well done. This included identifying risks associated with SQL injection, improper error handling, and the risk of exposure to sensitive financial data through insecure methods. Secure coding protects data integrity and ensures confidentiality of sensitive information, helps prevent data breaches, and helps to ensure compliance with legal or regulatory standards. Coding securely serves as a safeguard in preventing organizations from potential financial losses or damage to their reputation.

3. What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Company well-being is drastically improved through secure software. This is due to the benefits of preventing data breaches and unauthorized access, thereby enhancing customer trust, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. This mitigates the risk of attacks while assisting in avoiding financial, legal, or reputational damages while ensuring company growth by providing reliable and secure software.

4. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The manual code review proved to be the most time-consuming and most challenging. This required a deep understanding of potential threats and vulnerabilities coupled with an extensive analysis of the codebase to identify such issues as SQL injection points or insecure API implementation. This was a valuable process that proved enlightening in providing a better ability to identify vulnerabilities and understand the consequences of poor security standards.

5. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Additional layers of security were provided through the implementation of input validation, securing APIs, encapsulating sensitive data, and ensuring proper error handling. With future assessments in mind, this multifaceted approach coupled with a combination of automated static analysis tools and manual reviews could be used in conjunction to identify vulnerabilities. Such an approach ensures optimal coverages and assists in the selection of appropriate mitigation techniques contingent upon the severity of such vulnerabilities.

6. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The implementation of detailed unit and security testing were employed to ensure code was both functional and secure. Rerunning static code analysis tools and further conducting manual code reviews helped check for any introduced vulnerabilities. This maintained overall security while simultaneously ensuring optimal functionality.

7. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The utilization of static code analysis tools, the OWASP dependency checker, and strict adherence to secure coding practices such as input validation and error handling were beneficial for this project. Such tools and techniques will continue to prove invaluable in future endeavors by facilitating early identification of vulnerabilities to ensure software adheres to standard best security practices.

8. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

The ability to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities early in the development cycle is a key skill to possess in secure software development. Demonstrations of expertise in secure coding practices coupled with the ability to provide robust software security assessments are two valuable skills demonstrated in this project. Overall, this demonstrates the developer’s ability to assess risks or vulnerabilities, implement secure code solutions, and ensure the overall functionality and security of a fully functional software application.
